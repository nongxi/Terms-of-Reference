## Terms of Reference

## Background
For the amateur enthusiast, data in football is not easily obtained. Media outlets and football clubs pay a premium for the data, which a handful of statistical websites publish.  However, this is controlled and largely inaccessible due to either the technical skills required to capture the data or the time required to scour such sites.  As such, participation is restricted and therefore, as a community, progress is hindered and in danger of becoming too inward looking.  
OnsideFC (OpeN Source Integrated Data Environment) is a unique crowd sourcing project which breaks down these barriers by supporting and promoting the amateur community.

## Guiding Principles
The principles which steer the project are synonymous with those of the open source model:
+ Transparency - in the methods adopted and in the governance of the project.
+ Participation - non-exclusive membership which encourages contributors.
+ Collaboration - working in partnership to grow the community and develop ideas

## Objectives
+ Facilitate participation in and promotion of the analytics community
+ Create an open source directory of football statistics, derived data and metrics.
+ Develop best practice in data collection and metric development, to include standardised terminology and methodology for consistency in reporting
+ Help and support each other and help grow knowledge and experience within the community.
+ Provide a platform on which to build on and link to existing research (including the wider sports analytics community) and encourage collaboration

## Membership
Non-exclusive membership, open to all contributors.
